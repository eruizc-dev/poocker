# Poocker

Poocker stands for **Poor's man Docker**, but can also be interpreted as a
*shittier* version of it

### Features:
 - It may create images and run containers
 - 69% chance of breaking your system
 - Blatant copy of [Bocker](https://github.com/p8952/bocker)
 - Inspired by [Build your own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)

### Resources:

If you're trying to learn a little more about images, containers, linux
namespaces and btrfs subvolumes this is a cool project. Here's a list of cool
guides and references I used to learn and develop this:

 - [Bocker - p8952](https://github.com/p8952/bocker)
 - [Understanding the Podman internals - Cloud Native Islamabad](https://youtu.be/kJnxeinEWyA)
 - [unshare - manpages](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/unshare.1.html)
